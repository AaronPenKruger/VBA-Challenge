# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge - Aaron PenKruger
This assignment was to create VBA code that will iterate over a list of daily stock values. This should return each ticker name, the yearly return and the total volume of trade for each. Then a second for loop was created to find the max percentage increase, the max percentage decrease and the max total volume. 

I had to restart this project with a different, more efficient approach, iterating only over the first column, instead of nesting a third for-loop. This was possible under the assumption that the values given are arranged alphabetically and then chronilogically.
